# Python Video Poker Simulator

Messing around trying to create a simulator for video poker.

Ideally will be able to get distribution of outcomes of playing
different games for *X* hands using different strategies (for now only care about realistic "human" optimal strats)

Once this is accomplished want to be able to run simulations involving *n* hands.
