# Python Video Poker Simulator

Messing around trying to create a simulator for video poker.

Ideally will be able to get distribution of outcomes of playing
different games for *X* hands using different strategies (for now only care about realistic "human" optimal strats)

Once this is accomplished want to be able to run simulations involving *n* hands.

Turns out python is slow as mud. Need to optimize, currently takes ~30seconds per hand on my local MacBook Pro using current main.py. Isn't too bad, if we want to run simulation for 1MM hands will only take about THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY DAYS.
